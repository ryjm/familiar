Familiar
========
Familiar is (will be) a general-purpose quantified reasoning assistant--a tool for those who want to improve their [inevitably imperfect thinking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) regarding whatever it is they care about using [**_SCIENCE_**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).

Goals
-----
* A convenient UI for entering data and describing possible models on that data
* Fun pictures of personally relevant Bayes nets for you to look at
* Automated data collection from various Quantified Self apps/devices and web services via API
* Guided experimentation to quickly and confidently determine the most significant factors impacting your productivity, mood, health, profit, etc.
* Better Living Through Numbers
